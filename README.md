# My personal portfolio
Here you can find some of the projects I've been working on since 2021.
When I started this journey I learned HTML and CSS without using a framework or library, that's the reason I don't use, for example, React, for this project. Here I maintain the things as simple as I want (Btw, you can find projects where I use frameworks but it is after 2021 ðŸ‘€).

Each project has its own charm because it shows all the learning stages I've gone through. So you can find a plane website with HTML and CSS and then a full stack application.
