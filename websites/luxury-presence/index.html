            Why you should hire an agent who has partnered 
            with a luxury real estate marketing company.
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest perks of working with a real 
            estate agent is their ability to market your 
            property to the right target audience. A 
            professional agent with the right experience will
            be able to identify who will be interested in your
            property and implement effective strategies to reach 
            them via their website, paid advertising, social 
            media, and other means. When you work with an agent 
            who has partnered with 
            <a href="https://www.luxurypresence.com/" 
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Luxury Presence,</a> you benefit 
            from the many different types of marketing capabilities
            the company offers. Here is how:

            Paid Advertising on All Channels

            To reach your potential buyers, 
            <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/identifying-target-market-important-company-76792.html" 
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              you have to know who they are,
            </a> where they spend their time online, and 
            how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use
            luxury real estate marketing services are able to 
            identify your niche market, then create paid ads on 
            Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach 
            those interested in your property. These paid ad 
            campaigns are highly customized and targeted, 
            ensuring you are not spending money marketing to 
            those who are not in the market for a property 
            such as yours.

            Expert Content Production
          </h2>
          <p>
            Content is one of the most powerful resources a real 
            estate agent has to promote your property. Being able
            to create high-quality content such as video and 
            copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the 
            agents who use luxury real estate marketing services 
            above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 
            <a href="https://www.nateisaacs.com/why-real-estate-agents-should-use-video-in-their-marketing/" 
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an 
            agent who uses video
            </a>—and for good reason. An agent who
            uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on 
            a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they 
            use video to market your property, they are showing 
            viewers what it would really be like to walk through 
            and live in your home—something that is much more 
            difficult to do with a written description.
            However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also 
            important. Your property needs to be described in 
            appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any 
            additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those
            agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to 
            experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, 
            website copy, and content marketing pieces that make 
            your property attractive to potential buyers.

            Effective Search Engine Optimization
          </h2>
          <p>
            Recent research has shown that 
            <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/infographics/where-buyers-found-the-home-they-purchased" 
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              44% of buyers found the home they purchased
            </a> on the internet. Many of 
            them simply googled the search terms that they 
            wanted in a new home and started their search that 
            way. For your home to show up in these types of 
            searches, your real estate agent needs to use the 
            right terms in your online marketing. The effective 
            use of these terms is referred to as search engine 
            optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and 
            correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one
            that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. 
            When a potential buyer searches terms that match your 
            home, your property will show up in the results and 
            provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

            Social Media Marketing
          </h2>
          <p>
            If your real estate agent is an influencer on social 
            media, he or she has access to thousands of niche 
            buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be
            an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate 
            a large chunk of their time to social media or they
            need to partner with luxury real estate marketing 
            service providers who can put in the work for them. 
            Wouldn't you rather your agent spent his or her time
            marketing your property and let an expert handle 
            their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, 
            our dedicated success team utilizes an agent's 
            stories and feed posts to help them go viral and
            become an authority in their industry. Once they've
            harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, 
            they can use their voice to advocate for your 
            home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

            Immersive Property Experience
          </h2>
          <p>
            Every real estate agent's success starts with their
            website. If an agent doesn't have a responsive, 
            user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and 
            provides an immersive experience for viewers who 
            want to look at properties, they've already lost
            their advantage. Those agents who work with Luxury
            Presence have websites that are designed and managed
            by seasoned professionals who know what property 
            buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress 
            with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities,
            and lead capture strategies that help agents sell 
            your home. Agents are further supported by analytics
            reporting, SEO optimization, third party integrations,
            and a reporting dashboard to help them easily utilize 
            their site and maximize its potential. An agent who 
            is backed by a powerful website is one who can easily
            reach a niche audience, streamline the selling process,
            and ensure your home gets the best promotion possible.

            A Powerful Network of Referral Partners and Fellow Agents
          </h2>
          <p>
            No matter how many powerful tools your real estate agent
            has at his or her disposal, sometimes word-of-mouth 
            marketing is still the best way to sell a property. 
            Agents who work with luxury real estate marketing 
            services are connected with referral partners and a 
            community of agents who can help them find the perfect 
            buyer for your property. They can market your home 
            specifically to individuals they've identified through 
            their sources to be ready to purchase a home just like 
            yours. This allows them to bypass traditional listings, 
            saving both of you time, money, and unnecessary frustration.

            When you work with an agent who has partnered with Luxury 
            Presence, you will be hiring one who has a powerful
